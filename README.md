# Meteor-Shower

In this repository is a game called "Meteor Shower" that resembles the famous Space Invaders game.

This project was made in a group of three, for a university course named Introduction to Computer Architecture, in the second semester of my Computer Science and Engineering degree.

It was written in Assembly, more specifically, for a processor named PEPE-16 (Special Processor for Education, in English); however, it shares some syntatic similarities with ARM Assembly code.

The game is thoroughly explained in the report file, and the project requisits in the file with such name (both in Portuguese); the code is written and commented in Portuguese.
